# Class representatives

The goal of this semi-lab project is:
* take a dataset
* perform an exploratory data analysis (data visualization)
* create a sklearn pipeline for data preprocessing
* add new features (one hot encoding for example)
* add predictive model as the last step of the pipeline
* prepare a report with model explainability
